# MessageEncryptionDecryption

## Introduction
Cryptographic systems are used to keep data secure and safer during transmission so that it cannot be accessed by any other individual other than the receiver of that data. It is very commonly used in almost every aspect of life where there is a need to share data with other people. It helps users to keep their data secure by using end to end encryption at both the sender and receiver end.


## Abstract
Cryptography is very commonly used in almost every aspect of life where there is a need to share data with other people. It protects the data which have to be shared. Data will be encrypted before transmission, encrypted data will be transmitted and then decrypted after transmission and received by the receiver. But most hackers hack the data which is less secured and encrypted using simpler techniques. Our cryptographic system helps the users to keep their data secure by using safer and difficult encrypting techniques which cannot be easily understood by hackers.

## Requirements
Our cryptographic system has the following requirements.
- Users must provide the data which has to be sent.
- Users must provide their own id and also receiver id.
- Users must provide the key which has been used for encryption.
- Users donâ€™t know the technique of encryption.


## Data Structures
Following data structures have been used by our cryptographic system.
- Hash tables
- Linked lists
- Trees
- Queues
